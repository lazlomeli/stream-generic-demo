# Voice Recording Implementation for Stream Chat

This project now includes comprehensive voice recording functionality that allows users to send voice messages in Stream Chat conversations.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¤ Voice Recording
- **Record Voice Messages**: Click the microphone button to start recording
- **Stop Recording**: Click the stop button to finish recording
- **Preview & Send**: Review your recording before sending
- **Cancel Recording**: Cancel and re-record if needed

### ðŸŽµ Voice Message Playback
- **Play/Pause Controls**: Standard audio playback controls
- **Seek Functionality**: Click on the waveform to jump to specific parts
- **Playback Speed Control**: Adjust speed from 0.5x to 2x
- **Visual Waveform**: See audio visualization with progress indication
- **Duration Display**: Shows current time and total duration

### ðŸ“± User Experience
- **Real-time Recording Timer**: See how long you've been recording
- **File Size Information**: Know the size of your voice message
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Smooth Animations**: Polished UI with hover effects and transitions

## How It Works

### 1. Recording Process
1. Click the microphone button below the message input
2. Grant microphone permissions when prompted
3. Speak your message while watching the recording timer
4. Click the stop button to finish recording
5. Preview your message and click send

### 2. Message Structure
Voice messages are sent as attachments with the following properties:
```typescript
{
  type: 'voiceRecording',
  asset_url: string,        // Base64 encoded audio data
  mime_type: 'audio/webm', // Audio format
  file_size: number,        // File size in bytes
  duration: number,         // Duration in seconds
  title: string,           // Message title
  waveform_data: number[]  // Visual waveform data
}
```

### 3. Playback Features
- **Waveform Visualization**: Visual representation of audio with clickable seek points
- **Progress Bar**: Shows current playback position
- **Speed Control**: Cycle through 0.5x, 1x, 1.5x, and 2x playback speeds
- **Time Display**: Current time and total duration

## Technical Implementation

### Components Created

#### `CustomMessageInput.tsx`
- Extends Stream Chat's MessageInput component
- Adds voice recording controls below the text input
- Handles microphone access and audio recording
- Manages recording state and user interactions

#### `CustomAttachment.tsx`
- Custom attachment handler for voice recording messages
- Implements `VoiceRecordingPlayer` for full playback functionality
- Implements `QuotedVoiceRecording` for quoted message display
- Integrates with Stream Chat's attachment system

#### `VoiceRecordingDemo.tsx`
- Demo component showcasing voice recording features
- Provides user guidance and feature overview
- Styled with attractive gradient background

#### `VoiceRecording.css`
- Comprehensive styling for all voice recording components
- Responsive design with mobile optimizations
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Professional color scheme and typography

### Audio Format
- **Recording Format**: WebM audio (widely supported)
- **Encoding**: Uses MediaRecorder API for efficient recording
- **Quality**: Optimized for voice messages with reasonable file sizes

### Browser Compatibility
- **Modern Browsers**: Full support for MediaRecorder API
- **Mobile Devices**: Works on iOS Safari and Android Chrome
- **Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation for unsupported features

## Usage Examples

### Basic Voice Message
```typescript
// The component automatically handles:
// 1. Microphone access
// 2. Audio recording
// 3. Message formatting
// 4. Stream Chat integration
```

### Custom Playback Rates
```typescript
// Available playback speeds:
const playbackRates = [0.5, 1, 1.5, 2];
// Users can cycle through these by clicking the speed button
```

### Waveform Customization
```typescript
// Generate custom waveform data:
const waveformData = Array.from({ length: 50 }, () => Math.random() * 0.8 + 0.2);
```

## Integration with Stream Chat

### Message Sending
Voice messages are sent through Stream Chat's standard message API:
```typescript
await channel.sendMessage({
  text: '',
  attachments: [voiceRecordingAttachment]
});
```

### Attachment Handling
The `CustomAttachment` component automatically detects voice recording attachments and renders the appropriate player:
```typescript
if (props.attachment.type === 'voiceRecording') {
  return <CustomVoiceRecording attachment={attachment} isQuoted={props.isQuoted} />;
}
```

## Styling and Customization

### CSS Variables
The voice recording components use a consistent color scheme that can be easily customized:
- Primary: `#007bff` (Blue)
- Success: `#28a745` (Green)
- Danger: `#dc3545` (Red)
- Secondary: `#6c757d` (Gray)

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Desktop**: Full feature set with larger controls
- **Tablet**: Optimized spacing and sizing
- **Mobile**: Compact controls and touch-friendly interactions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Microphone Access Denied
- Check browser permissions
- Ensure HTTPS connection (required for MediaRecorder)
- Try refreshing the page

#### Recording Not Working
- Verify browser supports MediaRecorder API
- Check console for error messages
- Ensure microphone is not used by other applications

#### Playback Issues
- Check audio file format compatibility
- Verify audio element is properly loaded
- Check browser audio settings

### Debug Information
Enable console logging to see detailed information about:
- Recording start/stop events
- Audio blob creation
- Message sending process
- Playback state changes

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Audio Compression**: Reduce file sizes while maintaining quality
- **Multiple Audio Formats**: Support for MP3, WAV, etc.
- **Voice-to-Text**: Automatic transcription of voice messages
- **Advanced Waveform**: Real-time waveform during recording
- **Voice Effects**: Audio filters and enhancements

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Load audio files on demand
- **Caching**: Cache frequently played voice messages
- **Compression**: Optimize audio quality vs. file size
- **Streaming**: Progressive audio loading for long messages
